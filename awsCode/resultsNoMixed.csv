489,327578,positive,Sumeet we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment. Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup.  We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic) but I don't see any value there. If you could explain a bit about your exact requirement I might be able to provide an alternative to this.  Thanks Ruwan,NEUTRAL,0.6634100675582886

Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.

621,455643,positive,[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example OutputStats is not completed abstracted out as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though and it would be appropriate to put into trunk but these are not my decisions to make.   With regard to public methods that were changed I don't think most of them are a big deal besides as Cheolsoo said the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.   However the change from JobStats to MRJobStats while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user) could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also.,POSITIVE,0.9479387998580933

639,467084,positive,bq. Though pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go the contrib projects (owlzebrapiggybank/hiverc) didnt compile I think because either it didn't download dependices of those projects or didn't include them in the build path.  Ashutosh yes. I did realize it and as you rightly guessed it is because the ivy-dependency list doesn't have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages. This is not an issue related to eclipse-classpath. However there has to be a JIRA opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy.   Can you please file a JIRA for this?

669,490667,positive,Hi Michael thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.  I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.  I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)). Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).  My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check).  Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like      ...         if (manager.getCopyNew()) {             int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length],POSITIVE,0.3621666729450226

Yes this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard äóñ I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst äóñ wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already ehm a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data eg inCount newAddress etc.  That required making the first pass FST """"modal"""" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<IntX>) I think?  Second the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack) and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord write-non-ord read-packed read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).  """,POSITIVE,0.6327182054519653
853,668427,neutral,From the dev list didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>)  The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a äóìcloneäóË of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory your GC simply drives crazy äóñ we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/äó_ which does heavily locking. In contrast MMapDir is completely lock-free!   Until there is no replacement we will not remove it but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. Thatäó»s a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. Itäó»s currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before so you can allocate a buffer thatäó»s better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap.....  RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput add MMapIndexOutput but not based on a mmapped buffer instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap äóñ both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot.   The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole äóìmessageäóË on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs..... ,NEUTRAL,0.5404604077339172

Not only do I use but I also promote it everywhere I go. I just did a hands-on lab using JSPWiki to create 'qwiki' WEB apps for 40 people at DEVCON 2007. It got excellent reviews.  I promote this as an Enterprise Open-source solution. If a company wanted to purchase a support contract or services for a production implementation of the product who should they contact?

I chose to throw exception only if file.canWrite because I was trying to minimise the impact of the change. It's not clear to me whether setLastModified might work when !file.canWrite. However it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call similar to getRecordIfStored it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.  3.

I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights or putting it another way it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e. getSystemSession(String) is package private WorkspaceInfo is protected). I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public but they're useful from within the core. In my case for the GC. I'm very interested in using another way to walk every workspace but this other way should guarantee that the repository won't shutdown during a walk operation. I'll check the solution Thomas said he'll be proposing but in the mean time that is what I'm using. Still I don't see why this APIs aren't public. Regards,NEUTRAL,0.8247925043106079

In EditLogFileInputStream why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress that means we don't know the lastTxId so it would be INVALID_TXID right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS we pass in INVALID_TXID even though the log is not yet in progress.

1154,939053,neutral,This looks like it needs rebased onto trunk.  The posted patch includes generated code ({{AdminProtos.java}}) please remove.  Please add javadoc for the new classes and new public methods on existing classes.  {{FavoredNodeAssignmentHelper#placeSecondaryAndTertiaryWithRestrictions}} introduces a {{while(true)}} block containing non-trivial branching logic.

1157,942607,positive,Hi Ted Matteo  Thanks for the review.  The commands.rb has some existing logic that tries to 'rescue' some exceptions. It will get more and more difficult to keep it generic artificially as we evolve and add more ... The approach to expand (instead of shrink) this logic is not a bad or ugly one ...

1171,961159,negative,Hi Lars sorry about the delay in responding. Good point about the TreeMap always returning result in a deterministic ordering. The patch itself I think is still beneficial because it removes a little bit of redundancy in the existing equality code. IMO the fix makes it easier to understand as well. In addition the tests are beneficial since we were missing coverage there.  I think it'd be better if the fix were in sooner but it's probably not an issue if we moved it to 0.94.7.,POSITIVE,0.9397467374801636

1227,1016110,neutral,It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92.  My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.

1255,1038733,neutral,Yes bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql.  Preferably it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface I can always implement my comparisons in another place but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable and one in the Comparator).  I don't see how column families and the key comparator are related except that they are both table-level metadata. Yes I agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table. ,MIXED,0.887828528881073

1280,1061050,neutral,VM behaves like BEA but not as RI. It seems that RI checks method name 2 times and 2 times runs through constant pool. I suppose that first time it runs through constant pool just after parsing and second time before verifying. The first check is obligatory and the second only if -Xverify is on. It looks like code is duplicated. Now our vm makes check after parsing and only if -Xverify is on.   I suppose to leave it as it is or make method name check independently of -Xverify flag.,NEGATIVE,0.9280920028686523

This is already present (by setting conf.setBoolean(""""fs.automatic.close"""" false) ) So I'm not sure what problem this JIRA is fixing. Or are we planning for the future?

The above isn't complete (it needs e.g. 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[] int int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.

1469,1191038,negative,Hello   Sure you are right here I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.  As you (and RFC959) say when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.          The sender converts the data from an internal character             representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII             representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver             will convert the data from the standard form to his own             internal form.   Actually  according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII  for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.  So I don't know ... Any way this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.      ,NEUTRAL,0.8308935165405273

1525,1361901,negative,I think my first preference  would be to make this only a java 7 and up feature. The change is very clear and we can use our normal testing methods.

I ran without the security manager so I did not get it set.

I recommend adding class and method comments to the test classes so that reviewers will know what these tests are supposed to stress.

However I don't think this patch should be accepted as-is :-) There is a LOT of duplicate code in my patch. I did this because I didn't want to mess with the QueryRunner code if everyone thought my idea was stupid. However there are a number of methods in the AsyncQueryRunner are improved from the QueryRunner (see DBUTILS-79).

1596,1455325,neutral,Noah said heäó»s going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch but Iäó»d like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error I didnäó»t suggest it is a grunt.js error but itäó»s the way we use Autotools. In particular in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \     äó_and so on  In that list there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js` e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain why this isnäó»t a make error. ,NEUTRAL,0.6653346419334412

1624,1478766,neutral,Well since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.   First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class when you turn on caching in this transformer the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then  that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects.,NEGATIVE,0.8517350554466248

I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads. Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it. I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).  Of course I'm a newbie but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed) not with Click?  Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice but this one is not. Making it even more complex is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.  From what I saw one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however Click should remain very simple otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford """"published"""" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility so """"experiments"""" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )  My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that """"black box feeling"""" - and it's not fun ).  I think like this are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :). """,POSITIVE,0.7830948829650879

Off hand they don't seem bad but something feels weird about it.  2) While I can appreciate the cut working like a remove it's a bit weird to be prompted to delete the item.  3) I can't paste an ObjEntity I just cut back to the same DataMap.  With the lack of an undo feature the only reasonable thing for me to do is a revert the datamap.  4) I think my font changed for labels.  I'll have to verify that.

In any case fixing the build is pretty trivial the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).  Other than that: * I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean """"wait for nothing on commit not even a local one"""" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw but in the meantime it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE). * We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL) but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs.""",NEUTRAL,0.809748649597168

So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit.  But there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there fine I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore.

3506,1423534_5,neutral,I have some comments on the new patch:  PermDescriptor  o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass.,NEUTRAL,0.9413580298423767
3507,1423534_6,neutral,In my experience this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used.,NEGATIVE,0.6034665703773499
3508,1423534_7,neutral,"So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID"".",NEGATIVE,0.6115829348564148

3510,1423534_9,neutral,o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).,NEUTRAL,0.7041126489639282
3511,1423534_10,neutral,However I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.,NEUTRAL,0.8845503926277161

3516,1423534_15,neutral,SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory  o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.,NEUTRAL,0.8156554102897644
3517,1423534_16,neutral,That is the key order should be ( schemaID sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName schemaID ).,NEGATIVE,0.7757604718208313
3518,1423534_17,neutral,This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty().,NEUTRAL,0.9421682357788086

3521,1423534_20,neutral,Note that if you swap the key order then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String SchemaDescriptor)   o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors one for each column in the table.,NEUTRAL,0.9873679280281067

3526,1423534_25,neutral,DataDictionaryImpl  o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor() and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods so they should be revised to describe the new methods.,NEUTRAL,0.913277804851532

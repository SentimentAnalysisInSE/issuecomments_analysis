But i much prefer $query.foo.bar over $query.get('foo.bar') so i'm not going to give that up quickly.  The type conversion suffixes are more than just nice since the main point of the ValueParser is to parse values.  If you don't care about type conversion then you may as well just put the source map into the context.  Anyway i'm going to see if i can make both work somehow.

Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup.  We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic) but I don't see any value there. If you could explain a bit about your exact requirement I might be able to provide an alternative to this.  Thanks Ruwan,positive

366358,First draft.  This just does the mapping in the constructor to the comparator.  We could do setNextReader but I can't imagine it will really make much difference given the small number of items that we typically would expect to be elevated.,neutral
366522,I created a class that extends UpdateRequestProcessor which logs calls to each method. In the console output you'll see that only the processAdd methods are called when using the DIH in debug mode and the user checks verbose and commit.

I'm assuming that once Lucene commits the files the UpdateRequestProcessor.processCommit method should be called too.   *UpdateRequestProcessorTest.class*  package org.apache.solr.handler.dataimport,neutral

371242,The DismaxRequestHandler and StandardRequestHandler are both deprecated and replaced with SearchHandler.     ,neutral
371315,bq. Actually DIH started as a standalone webapp inside AOL. We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware plan capacity/failover create firewall holes etc  Even if it were a standalone app I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load.  Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.  bq. Talking to multiple collections was never a goal for DIH – I'm not sure what value it will bring.   I've got a sharded index,neutral
371455,"{quote} ...but even if we don't do that i suppose it's also conceivable that someone might have their own Similarity implementation that is expensive to instantiate (ie: maintains some big in memory data structures?) and might want to be able to declare one instance and then refer to it by name in many different fieldType declarations. {quote}  I don't think this is really a use case we need to support: the purpose of Similarity today is to do term weighting not to be a huge data-structure holder.  While I know Mike's original patch went this way with LUCENE-2392 (e.g. norms) I'm not sure i like it being in Similarity in the future either.  Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields).   So I think we shouldn't really design for abuses of the API. If there are other use cases for ""named similarity"" that have to do with term weighting I'm interested. ",neutral

I don't think there's any point in compliance with legacy if nobody depended on the behavior (they couldn't specify the behavior before either).

455643,[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example OutputStats is not completed abstracted out as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though and it would be appropriate to put into trunk but these are not my decisions to make.   With regard to public methods that were changed I don't think most of them are a big deal besides as Cheolsoo said the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.   However the change from JobStats to MRJobStats while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user) could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also.,positive

467084,bq. Though pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go the contrib projects (owlzebrapiggybank/hiverc) didnt compile I think because either it didn't download dependices of those projects or didn't include them in the build path.  Ashutosh yes. I did realize it and as you rightly guessed it is because the ivy-dependency list doesn't have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages. This is not an issue related to eclipse-classpath. However there has to be a JIRA opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy.   Can you please file a JIRA for this? Thanks,positive

647618,"{quote} This wasn't a problem with my patch right?  That was an issue of the mahout script in trunk itself? {quote}  Yes it was a problem with the script in trunk. I believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars. Adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well. So no you didn't add this but it should be fixed (and is in the patch)  {quote} What is the -core option for?  I've never used it how does it work? {quote}  when you're running bin/mahout in the context of a build the -core option is used to tell it to use the build classpath instead of the classpath used for a binary release. This just follows the pattern established (by Doug?) in the hadoop and nutch launch scripts.  {quote} Also added a help message for the 'run' argument. {quote}  near line 72 in bin/mahout: (this is different from the --help question I had)  {code}   echo ""  seq2sparse            generate sparse vectors from a sequence file""   echo ""  vectordump            dump vectors from a sequence file""   echo ""  run                   run mahout tasks using the MahoutDriver see: http://cwiki.apache.org/MAHOUT/mahoutdriver.html"" {code}  {quote} So you already added the ability to load via classpath right? If we merge that way of thinking with what I'm currently working on (having a configurable ""MAHOUT_CONF_DIR"" which is used for all these props files) we could just have the mahout shell script just add MAHOUT_CONF_DIR to the classpath (the way you already have it adding the hardwired core/src/main/resources directory) and then it would work that way. {quote}  Yep that should do it as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources we should be good to go.

I haven't looked in trunk yet.    The Lucene.Net_4e branch should have a already have a snk. I could add the same snk file to trunk and the 2.9.4 branch when I go add the build scripts to the trunk this weekend so that all the branches are building strong assemblies.

The part i didnt like when exploring was more related to how term index/term dictionary are separated: {quote} divisor: generalize this into something simple like a Map<StringString> of codec ""parameters"" that you set on IWC/IR. split divisor from ""don't load terms index"". define these as constants where they belong. I got unhappy here in the ""splitting"" part because I wanted the divisor part in TermsIndexReaderBase but that doesnt extend FieldsProducer (where i wanted the ""don't load"" part) and wrap the terms dict instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the TermsIndexReaderBase... maybe we should fix that too? I think this confusing the way it is but I didnt look at how difficult this would be. {quote}  But I think maybe I was trying to tackle too much at once... still as an ""untyped"" parameter I thought it would be useful to fix the semantics all in one break rather than causing confusion down the road.

665037,Patch adds maybeRefreshBlocking which blocks on refreshLock. It also:  * Renames reopenLock to refreshLock * Shares the refresh logic between maybeRefresh and maybeRefreshBlocking. * Switches to use ReentrantLock instead of Semaphore(1): ** It allows to protectively obtain the lock in doMaybeRefresh (see comment in the code) ** It is better in general because it's equivalent to Semaphore(1) yet protects against an accidental bug where someone changes Semaphore(1) to Semaphore(>1).

666339,"lemme see if I can help with the test. I feel bad I didn't supply one with the prototype patch.  About the Solr integration: this looks good! We can use a similar approach for autosuggest too so this could configure the analyzer for LUCENE-3842.  I wonder if we should allow separate configuration of ""index"" and ""query"" analyzers? I know I came up with some use-cases for that for autosuggest but I'm not sure about spellchecking. I guess it wouldn't be overkill to allow it though.",neutral

668028,"Thanks Dawid.  bq. Yes this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard – I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst – wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already ehm a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data eg inCount newAddress etc.  That required making the first pass FST ""modal"" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<IntX>) I think?  Second the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack) and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord write-non-ord read-packed read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).  ",positive
668427,From the dev list didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>)  The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a “clone‿ of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory your GC simply drives crazy – we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/… which does heavily locking. In contrast MMapDir is completely lock-free!   Until there is no replacement we will not remove it but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. That’s a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. It’s currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before so you can allocate a buffer that’s better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap.....  RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput add MMapIndexOutput but not based on a mmapped buffer instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap – both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot.   The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole “message‿ on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs..... ,neutral

679428,"{quote} I don't really know much about NamedSPILoader but I think what you're suggesting. How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName? {quote}  It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!) but it works like Charset.forName(""ASCII"") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName Codec.listAllCodecs ...).  Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you ""register"" your classes in your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.  So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""Whitespace"") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars) are automatically available this way.  I think Uwe mentioned this idea before though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)  Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable.

904326,Thanks a ton for your review Todd. Here's an updated patch which addresses all of your comments except the following.  bq. In EditLogFileInputStream why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress that means we don't know the lastTxId so it would be INVALID_TXID right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS we pass in INVALID_TXID even though the log is not yet in progress.  I'm still working on producing an updated patch which also adds testing for the pending DN message queues.,positive

913040,Todd I briefly looked at the patch. It looks like you are trying to get rid of the Journal Spool in BN. Correct me if I am wrong. I don't think you can. BN makes a checkpoint from its memory state which differs it from SNN and CN. While it does it the namespace should be locked (for modifications) so the edits go into journal spool which is reapplied to memory after the checkpoint is finished. Please see the design doc in HADOOP-4539.,neutral

1016110,It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92.  My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.

1061050,VM behaves like BEA but not as RI. It seems that RI checks method name 2 times and 2 times runs through constant pool. I suppose that first time it runs through constant pool just after parsing and second time before verifying. The first check is obligatory and the second only if -Xverify is on. It looks like code is duplicated. Now our vm makes check after parsing and only if -Xverify is on.   I suppose to leave it as it is or make method name check independently of -Xverify flag.,neutral

1152903,> Do you think attached patch is generic?  Nothing is generic until it's used in more than one place.  The above isn't complete (it needs e.g. 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[] int int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration. ,neutral

Thanks a lot especially for the test case. http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=240459&view=rev http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=240461&view=rev  The result for 180 and -180 is definitely wrong. There's a bug that needs to be fixed eventually. But since this is low-priority for me I'm going to leave it for now. I've added a comment to the new test case block-container4a that explains what is wrong. So I think I'll close this issue.

1361901,I think my first preference  would be to make this only a java 7 and up feature. The change is very clear and we can use our normal testing methods.  Meanwhile users can set their umask appropriately.  My second preference would be only  to only change permissions by default  with java 7 and higher. I think we really need to have tests for the default configuration and non-portable tests might have to be customized to different environments which seems like a lot of effort for something that won't be used moving forward.  I am sorry I didn't chime in earlier.  Time has been quite tight recently.   ,negative

1411459,I found the reason why we observe different behaviors with the network server: Since you run with the default security manager you actually get derby.system.home set as a system property as a side effect (see line ca line 586 in NetworkServerControl.java) as part of the set-up of the security manager. I ran without the security manager so I did not get it set.   I do think though that the old behavior was buggy: I can't see why one should need to set derby.system.home explicitly to get the auto-boot behavior. Unless someone can explain why this should be so I'll file a bug for that. ,neutral

1455325,Noah said he’s going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch but I’d like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error I didn’t suggest it is a grunt.js error but it’s the way we use Autotools. In particular in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \     …and so on  In that list there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js` e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain why this isn’t a make error. ,neutral

1478766,Well since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.   First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class when you turn on caching in this transformer the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then  that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects.,neutral

1533314,I've just gotten a chance to look at this.  A few things jump out immediately.  1) I have to chew over the changes to Cayenne core a bit more.  Off hand they don't seem bad but something feels weird about it.  2) While I can appreciate the cut working like a remove it's a bit weird to be prompted to delete the item.  3) I can't paste an ObjEntity I just cut back to the same DataMap.  With the lack of an undo feature the only reasonable thing for me to do is a revert the datamap.  4) I think my font changed for labels.  I'll have to verify that.  Looking at #3 again actually I can't seem to paste at all.  I even tried creating a new DataMap and was unable to paste the ObjEntity to that.,neutral
1533520,Sorry it took so long to drag this up.  I think the issue I had was with the Customer => BillingInfo and Customer => ShippingInfo relationships.

In any case fixing the build is pretty trivial the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).  Other than that: * I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean ""wait for nothing on commit not even a local one"" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw but in the meantime it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE). * We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL) but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs.",neutral

I buy the premise of 2444 that you don't necessarily want to get hammered by compaction when you're first starting up (warming up caches).  So I don't think ""check for compactions ever N seconds"" is a great policy.

1191390_6,FileSystemView can have user object to indicate whose file system view it is representing.,neutral

1191390_11,Caching is a specialized function.,neutral
1191390_12,So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching.,neutral

1423534_6,In my experience this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used.,neutral
1423534_7,So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via "this.permUUID = permUUID".,neutral
1423534_8,o Once you do that you can get rid of the getUUID() setUUID() and getObjectID() methods in this class.,neutral
1423534_9,o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor).,neutral
1423534_10,However I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors.,neutral
1423534_12,But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle.,neutral
1423534_14,Don't worry that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work.,neutral
1423534_15,SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory  o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index.,neutral
1423534_16,That is the key order should be ( schemaID sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName schemaID ).,neutral
1423534_18,But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName schemaID ) which I'm not seeing.,neutral
1423534_22,SYSROLESRowFactory  o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array one cell for each column in the table.,neutral
1423534_23,DataDictionary  o The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method.,neutral
1423534_26,Thanks -Rick ,neutral
425267_2,This one fixes the end-date issue in the comment bean classes: URL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=782269&view=rev  And that resolves this issue in the trunk.,neutral
688399_1,Hey Chrisyou just moved the files right?!,neutral
21301_1,Also applies to the 4.x series,neutral
1946907_2,Attribute 'width' works fine.,neutral
1014458_2,Would be nice to have a batch/list functionality as well like we have for deletes/puts.,neutral
480162_1,It looks like the problem originates in PDFBOX-11.,neutral
480162_2,Many CID mappings are expressed as ranges which the code explodes into individual Integer->String pairs.,neutral
1836207_1,In the same pc I have a outlook client and It work fine the problem is with xplanner how can I  configurate xplanner for send mails ?,neutral
1836207_2,Thanks,neutral
2516675_1,ok I'm looking into this.,neutral
280697_1,Okay reviewed and tested patch with sqlite3 and bdb on trunk.,neutral
280697_2,One minor correction to configure without sqlite3.,neutral
280697_4,#NAME?,neutral
2192201_1,Have a look at hibernate.common.xml,neutral
412291_1,Hi David  This helps me understand what you were talking about - thanks!,neutral
412291_2,(Things weren't as clear at 2am ))    Yes we should probably definitely be removing the ThreadLocal entirely.,neutral
412291_3,I'll make those changes as soon as I can.,neutral
412291_4,#NAME?,neutral
766227_1,Patch applied in trunk.,neutral
766227_3,Thank you for your contribution.,neutral
1114706_3,Why use an ad-hoc script that's known (according Erik himself) to have false positive that require manual inspection (which is also not part of the version controlled source tree) when you we have a built-in (aspectj*.jars are already included as build/runtime dependencies) tool specifically for such tasks?,neutral
1114706_4,You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off.,neutral
360149_1,Ah ok ... thanks for the heads up.,neutral
1427702_1,Changes to the test look good and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct.,neutral
1427702_2,I would advise that a good thing to do once you have fixed this issue is to then perform a similar test modification for setting a valid value and using batching.,neutral
1673444_1,I've started to work towards support for visualising services and cascading configuration.,neutral
1673444_2,The changes in this patch aren't a complete solution but they're free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support.,neutral
1673444_3,I've introduced a decorator framework for relationships so we can draw the service triangles (or package names).,neutral
1673444_4,The service handling will need to be updated slightly once we're not working from the DummyInfoProvider.,neutral
1673444_5,Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak.,neutral
1673444_6,I've also started to add cascading configuration.,neutral
1673444_8,ComponentAppearances will also inherit from one another when we have nested components (like a bundle inside an application).,neutral
1673444_9,I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next.,neutral
1673444_10,In the new version elements have two methods - render() which draws them and apply() which  initialises shared properties like colour.,neutral
1673444_11,This allows for a two-phase rendering.,neutral
1673444_13,:)  I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation.,positive
1673444_14,I've also moved RelationshipElement to the elements namespace.,neutral
2130073_1,Looks like this is fixed :),positive
766038_1,Version 2.2.0RC3 is fine.,positive
1754304_1,Sounds like a good idea.,positive
1581490_2,For the CAMEL-3787 I think the key should be on the ftp client configure to find out right charset that the server is using.,neutral
804555_1,> MultipartEntity entity = new MultipartEntity(HttpMultipartMode.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE)   Use strict mode instead of browser compatibility.,neutral
1212896_2,Tests pass but there is some weirdness going on with rat failing on licenses because it tries to examine the surefire reports...,neutral
408618_1,Thanks for supplying the patch.,neutral
408618_4,Please close this bug if this is ok for you.,neutral
259521_1,I showed my interest on this idea in the dev-mailing list and currently started to explore the requirements and a design. ,neutral
2086495_2,Thanks,neutral
297441_1,OK will open the issue with Solr/Lucene.,neutral
297441_2,Many thanks for your help.,positive
1114268_2,Does this applies to 0.22 trunk or 0.23 trunk?,neutral
1767428_1,Thanks.,neutral
1767428_2,I found the note in the manual about @Resource and that fixes it.,neutral
1767428_3,At this point I'd suggest  peppering the docs with references to @Resource wherever it discusses autowiring things or about collections.,neutral
1767428_4,E.g. "note: if you're trying to auto wire a collection with annotations you'll need to use @Resource instead of @Autowired".,neutral
258148_1,I looked at all the TODO's in uimaj-core and found only one Sofa-related exception that needed update.,neutral
258148_2,Fixed it's foot.,neutral
1605030_1,Patch applied.,neutral

1605030_4,variables (Alexis Midon)" Sending        doc/settings_profiles.textile Transmitting file data .,neutral
1327335_1,The attached patch fixes two problems:   * the first one which happen when the class is loaded from the boot classloader (in which case we now use the system classloader to load the enclosing class)   * the second one which is the fact that all kind of linkage errors can happen when loading the class and this would really disturb the classloader correct behavior,neutral
747246_1,Could you please verify and/or adapt your patch against the current version at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/jcs/branches/generics-interface I was not able to apply your patch there.,neutral
1814664_1,A potentially legitimate use case of a {{set}} without an {{apply}} is a builder class that should not be accessed until the building is complete at which point the internal state will be accessed directly to produce the final result of some type.,neutral
1961214_1,Pull request available here:  https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-roo/pull/8  The changes are minor.,neutral

1083704_1,Committed to branch-2.1-beta branch-2 and trunk.,neutral
1069635_1,Verified patch applied as expected.,neutral
1412146_1,Dyre thanks for your comments.,neutral
1412146_4,I did a change to BULIDING.txt adding ${j14lib}/security.jar to java14compile.classpath in the description of how to build with IBM JDK.,neutral
1412146_5,I have not verified that it works and hope someone would confirm that it's correct.,neutral
533296_1,Jacopo  Thanks for diving in a pointing Scott at the appropriate screens.,neutral
533296_2,David  I completely agree that providing more intelligence in the PO creation process would be very helpful especially for larger businesses.,neutral
533296_3,I can just about cope with the amount of manual intervention required but in the not too distant future I can see the need for some of the rules you suggest.,neutral
533296_4,The idea of consolidating POs (or SOs I guess) came mainly because I end up having multiple small POs for some of my suppliers.,neutral
533296_5,However I also run into the opposite problem.,neutral
1489050_1,This should have been fixed by commit 26a5b76ee6b77909a7b8d5b00924f12e1671373d.,neutral
1489050_2,Verified on my vmware setup extract volume is working fine now.,neutral
680599_2,Anyway for this file it's not really important I think - a very simple and tiny file w/ no history to preserve?,neutral
2094157_1,Please keep this open until reverse tests are configured as we might have new issues coming from them.,neutral
1453891_1,Ok got it thanks for the explanation.,neutral
1453891_2,In any case the code for the toBytes method is written now so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes.,neutral
1453891_3,It would probably also be worth having optimized versions for primitive values instead of writing them to an Avro/Writable first to get the bytes representation.,neutral
145320_1,An example patch.,neutral
145320_2,Was unable to run the unit test I wrote (because my setup is being a jerk) but I'm more looking for input on the design.,neutral
724751_1,Thanks for the reviews committed the patch to trunk,neutral
289945_2,I seem to be having trouble applying the patches though and I'd hate for all these corrections and improvements to be lost.,neutral
289945_4,That would really help a lot.,neutral
289945_5,Thanks once again.,positive
451707_1,It is good to know that pluto has a problem here but I realy need servlets integrated pluto.,neutral
1984725_1,@Arnaud: My key looks exactly the same and was generated with Cygwin's ss-keygen.,neutral
1984725_2,The file has Unix line endings though ...  @Lukas: scpexe works for me with M2 despite the fact that it insists on a key even if an agent is running (WAGON-27).,neutral
677027_1,bq. OK w/ the latest patch all tests pass for me! Great  Awesome! :),positive
2113606_2,One of the things I changed in jnr-posix was to make stat and fstat use stati64 and fstati64 respectively instead of stat64 and fstat - the last may be why its breaking with jna-posix.,neutral
2113606_3,Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime ctime mtime fields).,neutral
2113606_4,Otherwise the WindowsFileStat structure looks ok apart from the st_blocks and st_blksize fields at the end which are not part of the windows stat64 struct so will probably be filled with either zero or garbage.  ,neutral
1540427_1,{quote}  Hmm looks like the backport blew away scrubtest on 1.2 as well.,neutral
1540427_4,Just for clarification skipBloomFilters is old.,neutral
1540427_5,#1 and #2 are incorrect.,neutral
456033_1,Great! Awesome work Nick and thanks for the clarification Bill. ,positive
1540427_7,2: In 2.0 the skipBloomFilters will be called on a 1.2 sstable also the skipBloomFilters currently is called against any sstable when scrubbing.,neutral
1186476_1,Great work...this is awesome stuff. ,positive
645538_1,I made a preliminary patch to share the idea how this can be fixed.,neutral

1020899_5,If we redid the meta tables in this format we'd be using an access that is natural to hbase a scan as opposed to the perverse expensive getClosestRowBefore we currently have that has to walk backward in meta finding a containing region.,neutral
1020899_6,This issue is about changing the way we name regions.,neutral
1020899_8,Converting to the new method we'd have to run a migration on startup changing the content in meta.,neutral
1020899_9,Up to this the randomid component of a region name has been the timestamp of region creation.,neutral
1020899_10,HBASE-2531 "32-bit encoding of regionnames waaaaaaayyyyy too susceptible to hash clashes" proposes changing the randomid so that it contains actual name of the directory in the filesystem that hosts the region.,neutral
1020899_11,If we had this in place I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change.,neutral

1116600_2,I don't see a direct relation between this issue and the issue of simplifying the implementation of efficient map-side joins (MAPREDUCE-1183 more or less).,neutral
1116600_4,File formats are forever.,neutral
1116600_7,But I'm not convinced its wise to add such support to the exisiting Java-only container file formats.,neutral
1116600_9,I don't however see that it follows that we should provide implementations of file formats with a large number of different serialization systems as that invites multiplicative long-term support issues.,neutral
1116600_10,I'd prefer that we instead direct users towards a single preferred high-level serialization system and a single preferred container.,neutral
1116600_12,We now need to migrate from these to a more expressive language-independent serialization system and container file.,neutral
1116600_14,Google benefits tremendously by having a single standard serialization system and container file format.,neutral
1116600_16,The further we depart from this the harder we make it to build systems like Dremel that multiply the utility of stored data.,neutral

694863_1,These 3 crashes happen while compiling DocumentWriter.invertDocument.,neutral
694863_2,It must be a bug in Sun's hotspot compiler.,neutral
694863_4,That method which inverts a single document was replaced with new code starting with 2.3 so it's possible you can workaround the bug by upgrading to 2.3 or 2.4.,neutral
514698_1,Improve patch : when the flexibleString is resolved search fields on root context and parameters map.,neutral
1604507_1,Yes but even for Java 5 a relative path to a directory with flattened dependencies would be shorter wouldn't it?,neutral
997092_1,Committed to 0.92 and trunk.,neutral
736254_4,The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages) but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier.,neutral
736254_5,In the same vein isolating the API interfaces into a separate package makes it a lot easier to manage than having everything dispersed around - e.g.,neutral
736254_6,if we want to create a jspwiki-api.jar we only need to jar up the contents of a particular subdirectory.,neutral
736254_7,If the developer wants to know whether he is using any possibly unstable components all he needs to do is to glance at the set of import statements on the top - if he's using other classes than org.apache.jspwiki.api.,neutral
736254_8,* he knows that the classes are potentially unstable.,neutral
736254_9,In addition it makes the committer's life easier since there is an agreement by convention that the APIs inside *.api are not to be touched without common agreement whereas anything outside of this package can be treated with more liberties.,neutral
1356706_2,What's the purpose of this line in the patch to BaseTestCase Kristian?,neutral

1664747_2,I like the idea of making sure that things that should be specified should be passed as method parameters in one go rather than through chaining which makes it a lot harder to see what is required.,neutral

1411121_1,Here's another crack at this:  1) The default behavior for Derby is the current behavior with all of its security holes for java routines.,neutral
1411121_2,2) To get secure behavior for java routines the customer has to explicitly opt-in.,neutral
1411121_6,Instead to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database.,neutral
1411121_7,3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives.,neutral
1411121_8,Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH.,neutral
1411121_9,Then we defer to the system class loader.,neutral

675071_1,Is the bug really in NGramTokenFilter?,neutral
675071_2,This seems to be a larger problem that would affect all tokenfilters that break larger tokens into smaller ones and recalculate offsets right?,neutral
675071_4,I think WordDelimiterFilter has special code that might avoid the problem (line 352) so it might be ok.  Is there any better way we could solve this: for example maybe instead of the tokenizer calling correctOffset() it gets called somewhere else?,neutral

1563411_7,IncomingStreamReader does clean the tmp file when there is an expection (there's an enclosing 'try catch').,neutral
1563411_8,The problem is that no exception is raised if the other side of the connection dies.,neutral
1563411_9,What will happen then is the read will infinitely read 0 bytes.,neutral

1563411_11,Note that without this patch there is an infinite loop that will hold a socket open forever (and consume cpu though very few probably in that case).,neutral

698238_1,> then we don't save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KB  I'm confused by this.,negative
698238_2,My assumption is that when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache.,neutral
698238_3,(The cost of randomly reading 1k is nearly the same as randomly reading 100k--both are dominated by seek.),neutral
698238_4,So if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you'll get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call.,neutral
698238_6,An alternate strategy is to not trust the buffer cache and read-ahead but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks.,neutral
698238_7,This can require 1MB or larger buffers so isn't always practical.,neutral

870799_2,I guess the gen stamp is unnecessary but the DN isn't going to automatically mlock newly appended data so the NN needs to somehow realize that the cached length is shorter than the new length and ask the DN to recache at the new length.,neutral

1463502_1,You forgot to mention the part where I said that I have absolutely no idea if MinSize is important for some other part of the code )  Also it looks like if we add a check in couch_db:doc_flush_binaries/2 to see if we're not streaming an attachment of unknown length and then pass that information to couch_stream:ensure_buffer/2 so that couch_stream can decide if it wants to allocate exactly the requested amount or some extra it'd solve the issue.,neutral

1665696_1,I can see why the test case just checks that the error string includes the exception text "foo".,neutral
1665696_2,That is a bit too lax I think.,negative
1665696_3,The problem is not that the exception text is lost completely it does come through just that it is wrapped in an AvroRuntimeException("Unknown datum type: "+datum) error.,neutral
1665696_4,So instead of the expected "java.lang.RuntimeException: foo" text being sent you get "org.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Unknown datum type: java.lang.RuntimeException: foo".,neutral

489,327578,positive,Sumeet we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment. Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup.  We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic) but I don't see any value there.

We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware plan capacity/failover create firewall holes etc  Even if it were a standalone app I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load.  Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.  bq.

621,455643,positive,[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example OutputStats is not completed abstracted out as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though and it would be appropriate to put into trunk but these are not my decisions to make.   With regard to public methods that were changed I don't think most of them are a big deal besides as Cheolsoo said the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.   However the change from JobStats to MRJobStats while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user) could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also.,POSITIVE,0.9479388

639,467084,positive,bq. Though pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go the contrib projects (owlzebrapiggybank/hiverc) didnt compile I think because either it didn't download dependices of those projects or didn't include them in the build path.  Ashutosh yes. I did realize it and as you rightly guessed it is because the ivy-dependency list doesn't have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages. This is not an issue related to eclipse-classpath. However there has to be a JIRA opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy.   Can you please file a JIRA for this?

669,490667,positive,Hi Michael thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.  I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.  I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)). Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).  My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check).  Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like      ...         if (manager.getCopyNew()) {             int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length],POSITIVE,0.362166673

I have spend some time reviewing the patch which I find quite elegant.   Some improvements to the patch would be  - make NutchDocument implement VersionedWritable instead of writable and delegate version checking to superclass - refactor getDetails() methods in HitDetailer to Searcher (it is not likely that a class would implement Searcher but not HitDetailer) - use Searcher delete HitDetailer and SearchBean  - Rename XXXBean classes so that they do not include """"bean"""". (I think it is confusing to have bean objects that have non-trivial functionality) - refactor LuceneSearchBean.VERSION to RPCSearchBean - remove unrelated changes from the patch.(the changes in NGramProfile HTMLLanguageParserLanguageIdentifier... correct me if i'm wrong)  As far as i can see we do not need any metadata for Solr backend and only need StoreIndex and Vector options for lucene backend so i think we can simplify NutchDocument#metadata.

Yes this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow?

Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard í_í_í± I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.

Granted this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already ehm a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data eg inCount newAddress etc.  That required making the first pass FST """"modal"""" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<IntX>) I think?  Second the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack) and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading and different classes for each format.

853,668427,neutral,From the dev list didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>)  The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a í_í_íåcloneí_í_í† of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory your GC simply drives crazy í_í_í± we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/í_í__ which does heavily locking. In contrast MMapDir is completely lock-free!   Until there is no replacement we will not remove it but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. Thatí_í_Œés a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. Ití_í_Œés currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before so you can allocate a buffer thatí_í_Œés better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap.....  RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput add MMapIndexOutput but not based on a mmapped buffer instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap í_í_í± both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot.   The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole í_í_íåmessageí_í_í† on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs..... ,NEUTRAL,0.540460408

You are right though if you are saving a service it will overwrite the existing one and it will remove any bindingTemplates if they are there.

989,810039,neutral,Oleg  I agree it does seem that the presence of the Proxy-Authorization header on the already authenticated connection causes re-authentication.  So for NTLM to work the proxy-auth header must be removed once authenticated.  I don't think either patch 2 or 3 handles this case unless (in the case of patch 2) the host also uses NTLM.  What we really need is a way to remove NTLM headers after the authentication has succeeded.  Mike,NEUTRAL,0.80970794

1117,904326,positive,Thanks a ton for your review Todd. Here's an updated patch which addresses all of your comments except the following.  bq. In EditLogFileInputStream why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress that means we don't know the lastTxId so it would be INVALID_TXID right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS we pass in INVALID_TXID even though the log is not yet in progress.  I'm still working on producing an updated patch which also adds testing for the pending DN message queues.,NEUTRAL,0.634419799

1125,913040,neutral,Todd I briefly looked at the patch. It looks like you are trying to get rid of the Journal Spool in BN. Correct me if I am wrong. I don't think you can. BN makes a checkpoint from its memory state which differs it from SNN and CN. While it does it the namespace should be locked (for modifications) so the edits go into journal spool which is reapplied to memory after the checkpoint is finished.

1227,1016110,neutral,It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92.  My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.  But I'm fine implementing the halfway fix if my argument still doesn't win you over :),MIXED,0.93237108

1233,1020463,neutral,So there is another thing here by deferring the evictions to the background thread you increase the chance that the block will be tenured then it must be collected from CMS space thus radically increasing the GC complexity of the cache.  Originally when the LRU block cache came in it made my collections 10x as slow until I disabled the block cache for compactions.  Unfortunately all these micro-optimizations might be falling under the GC wayside.   ,NEGATIVE,0.615807652

1255,1038733,neutral,Yes bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql.  Preferably it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface I can always implement my comparisons in another place but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable and one in the Comparator).  I don't see how column families and the key comparator are related except that they are both table-level metadata. Yes I agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table. ,MIXED,0.887828529

1280,1061050,neutral,VM behaves like BEA but not as RI. It seems that RI checks method name 2 times and 2 times runs through constant pool. I suppose that first time it runs through constant pool just after parsing and second time before verifying. The first check is obligatory and the second only if -Xverify is on. It looks like code is duplicated. Now our vm makes check after parsing and only if -Xverify is on.

The above isn't complete (it needs e.g. 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[] int int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration. ,NEUTRAL,0.45835191

1469,1191038,negative,Hello   Sure you are right here I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.  As you (and RFC959) say when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.          The sender converts the data from an internal character             representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII             representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver             will convert the data from the standard form to his own             internal form.   Actually  according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII  for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.  So I don't know ... Any way this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.      ,NEUTRAL,0.830893517

I ran without the security manager so I did not get it set.

However I don't think this patch should be accepted as-is :-) There is a LOT of duplicate code in my patch. I did this because I didn't want to mess with the QueryRunner code if everyone thought my idea was stupid. However there are a number of methods in the AsyncQueryRunner are improved from the QueryRunner (see DBUTILS-79).  I propose that we create a base or abstract class which both QueryRunner and AsyncQueryRunner extend. Thoughts? ,POSITIVE,0.640756011

1596,1455325,neutral,Noah said heí_í_Œés going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch but Ií_í_Œéd like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error I didní_í_Œét suggest it is a grunt.js error but ití_í_Œés the way we use Autotools. In particular in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \     í_í__and so on  In that list there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js` e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain why this isní_í_Œét a make error. ,NEUTRAL,0.665334642

1624,1478766,neutral,Well since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.   First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class when you turn on caching in this transformer the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then  that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects.,NEGATIVE,0.851735055

I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads. Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it. I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).  Of course I'm a newbie but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed) not with Click?  Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice but this one is not. Making it even more complex is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.  From what I saw one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however Click should remain very simple otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford """"published"""" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility so """"experiments"""" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )  My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that """"black box feeling"""" - and it's not fun ).  I think like this are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :). """,POSITIVE,0.783094883

In any case fixing the build is pretty trivial the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).  Other than that: * I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean """"wait for nothing on commit not even a local one"""" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw but in the meantime it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE). * We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL) but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs.""",NEUTRAL,0.80974865

And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there.

And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there fine I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker.

1777,1611541,neutral,yes parseLedgerConfig did throw an IOException.  since the bug is found in hub server topic can't be acquired due to hub server can't closing such kind ledger. if we don't add code in LedgerOpenOp we have to find all such kind ledgers and handle them manually (maybe delete them). throwing IOException here is OK for me. but I am not sure do we need to keep backward compatibility to handle data/metadata produced by old version. what is your opinion?,NEUTRAL,0.405321181

3521,1423534_20,neutral,Note that if you swap the key order then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String SchemaDescriptor)   o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors one for each column in the table.,NEUTRAL,0.987367928

3526,1423534_25,neutral,DataDictionaryImpl  o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor() and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods so they should be revised to describe the new methods.,NEUTRAL,0.913277805
